Ethan,

Buddy's due for his annual check-up and vaccinations. I've scheduled an appointment for next Tuesday at 3 PM with Dr. Johnson. Can you take him? If not, I can try to reschedule for when I have him next.

Let me know what works best.

Alex

Hi Alex,

Thanks for staying on top of Buddy's health needs. Unfortunately, I have a crucial meeting at work that I can't reschedule. Would it be possible for you to take him? I'm happy to cover the full cost of the visit this time.

If you can't make it work, let me know and I'll try to find someone who can take him.

Ethan
