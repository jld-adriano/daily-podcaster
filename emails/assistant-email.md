Subject: Travel Arrangements for SpaceX Meeting

Hi Jenny,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to update you on my travel plans for the SpaceX meeting:

1. I'll be flying from Shanghai to LA on August 19th, arriving at 7:15 AM.
2. I've booked a car rental and a hotel near SpaceX HQ in Hawthorne.
3. My meeting with Elon Musk is on August 20th at 5:30 AM.
4. I'll fly back to San Francisco on August 20th afternoon.

Could you please:
1. Arrange a call with our team for August 18th to go over final talking points?
2. Prepare a brief on the latest developments in our Venus project AI systems?
3. Make sure our Shanghai office has all the follow-up details from the supply chain meeting?

Thanks for your help!

Best,
Ethan
