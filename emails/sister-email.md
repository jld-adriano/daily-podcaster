Hey bro,

It's been a while since we last talked. How about we grab coffee this weekend? I feel like there's a lot going on and I could use some sibling time.

Also, have you talked to Mike recently? He's been acting a bit strange lately. I'm probably overthinking it, but I'd love your perspective.

Let me know if you're free on Saturday or Sunday.

Love,
Lisa
