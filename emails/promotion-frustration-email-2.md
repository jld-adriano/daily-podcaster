Subject: Career Advice Needed

From: Ethan Chen <ethan.chen@gmail.com>

Dear Dr. Lee,

I hope this email doesn't come as a surprise. I've always valued your mentorship, and I find myself in need of your advice once again.

I've been at NeuraTech for five years now, and despite my best efforts, I seem to have hit a ceiling. I've been passed over for promotion twice in the past year, despite leading successful projects and contributing significantly to the company's AI research.

I'm at a crossroads. Part of me wants to stick it out and prove my worth, but another part is tempted to look for opportunities elsewhere. I worry that staying might be perceived as complacency, but leaving might mean giving up on the groundbreaking work we're doing here.

Do you have any insights on how to navigate this situation? How did you handle career plateaus in your journey?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your time,
Ethan
