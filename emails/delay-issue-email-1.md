Subject: Production Delays - Urgent Update

Dear Ethan,

I regret to inform you that we're facing significant delays in our production schedule at the Shanghai facility. The primary reasons are:

1. Unexpected maintenance issues with our new AI-integrated assembly line.
2. Delays in receiving critical components from our suppliers.
3. Additional time required for quality checks on the new AI systems.

We're currently projecting a 2-week delay in meeting our production targets. The team is working around the clock to mitigate these issues, but I wanted to make you aware of the situation immediately.

Please let me know if you need any further information or if you'd like to discuss this in detail.

Regards,
Zhang Min
Production Manager
