Dear Mr. Chen,

Thank you for your interest in meeting with Mr. Musk. Unfortunately, his schedule is extremely tight for the next few months. The earliest availability I can offer is October 15th at 7:30 AM PT.

Please let me know if this works for you.

Best regards,
Sarah Johnson
Executive Assistant to Elon Musk

Dear Ms. Johnson,

Thank you for getting back to me. I understand Mr. Musk has a busy schedule, but October 15th is quite far out, and the Venus project timeline is rather pressing. Is there any possibility of finding an earlier slot, even if it's just for 30 minutes?

I appreciate your help in this matter.

Best regards,
Ethan Chen
