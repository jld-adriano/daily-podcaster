Dear Mr. Chen,

Please find attached your quarterly investment portfolio update. Key points:

1. Your tech-focused ETFs have shown strong performance, up 12% this quarter.
2. We've rebalanced your portfolio to maintain your desired 70/30 stock/bond ratio.
3. Recommendation: Consider increasing your contributions to your Roth IRA.

Would you like to schedule a call to discuss your long-term financial goals and how we can help you achieve them?

Best regards,
