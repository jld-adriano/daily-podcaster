Subject: Passed over again

Hey Mike,

I hope this email finds you well. I hate to dump this on you, but I need to vent a bit. I just found out that I've been passed over for the Senior AI Architect position... again.

I don't get it. I've been pulling 60-hour weeks, delivered the Venus project ahead of schedule, and even presented at three major conferences this year. What more do they want?

To make matters worse, they gave the position to Brad from the robotics division. Don't get me wrong, Brad's good, but he doesn't have half the experience I do in NLP.

I'm starting to wonder if I have a future at NeuraTech. Maybe it's time to dust off the old resume?

Sorry for the rant. Let me know if you're free for a coffee later. I could use a friendly ear.

Ethan
