Subject: Christmas plans - are you kidding me?

Ethan,

I just saw your family's Christmas photos with Buddy and Max on Instagram. What the hell? It was MY turn to have them for Christmas. We agreed on this months ago!

You can't just change plans without telling me. Those dogs are as much mine as they are yours. I had presents for them and everything. My family was looking forward to seeing them.

This is so typical. You always put your family first without any consideration for anyone else. 

I want the dogs for New Year's AND the following weekend. No arguments.

Alex,

Whoa, calm down. Did you forget about the email you sent last month? YOU said you were going to Aspen with your new boyfriend and asked if I could take the dogs. I still have the email!

Don't come at me with this "typical" BS. I've bent over backwards to accommodate your schedule ever since we split. 

And for the record, my family asks about you every time I see them. They're not the inconsiderate ones here.

You can have them for New Year's as planned, but the weekend after is mine. I'm not giving up my time because you forgot your own plans.

Check your old emails before you start throwing accusations around.

- Ethan
