Subject: Reminder: Family Dinner This Sunday

From: Mom <linda.chen@gmail.com>

Dear Ethan,

Just a reminder that we're having our family dinner this Sunday at 6 PM. Your father is making his famous dumplings, and your sister will be video calling from New York.

Don't forget to bring that book on AI ethics you mentioned â€“ your father is very interested in discussing it with you.

Love,
Mom

P.S. Are you still coming alone, or will you be bringing someone special this time?
