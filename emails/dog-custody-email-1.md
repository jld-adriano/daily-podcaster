Subject: Dog Schedule This Month

Hi Alex,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to touch base about Buddy and Max's schedule for this month. Here's what I was thinking:

- I'll take them this weekend (July 8-10)
- You have them next weekend (July 15-17)
- I'll take them the following weekend (July 22-24)
- You have them the last weekend (July 29-31)

Does this work for you? Also, I have a business trip coming up in August. Can we discuss arrangements for that time?

Thanks,
Ethan

Hey Ethan,

Thanks for reaching out. The schedule looks good to me. 

For your August trip, how long will you be gone? I should be able to keep them, but I'd need to know the dates to make sure I don't have any conflicts.

Also, Max seemed a bit under the weather last time I had him. Did you notice anything?

Take care,
Alex
