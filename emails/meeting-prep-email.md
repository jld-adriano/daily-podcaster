Dear Ethan,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to touch base regarding your meeting tomorrow with the CEO of SpaceX about the potential AI applications for the Venus exploration project.

Key points to remember:
1. Focus on how our AI can enhance the shuttle's autonomous systems
2. Discuss the ethical implications of AI in space exploration
3. Be prepared to talk about potential collaboration between NeuraTech and SpaceX

Remember, you've earned this opportunity. Stay confident and be yourself.

Best of luck,
