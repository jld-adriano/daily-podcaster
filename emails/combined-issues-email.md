Subject: Comprehensive Update: Shanghai Facility Challenges

Dear Ethan,

I'm writing to provide a comprehensive update on the challenges we're facing at the Shanghai facility:

Labor Issues:
1. Ongoing negotiations with union representatives.
2. Training programs being developed for new automated systems.
3. Continued discussions about safety protocols.

Production Delays:
1. 2-week delay due to assembly line issues and component shortages.
2. Additional 4-6 week potential delay due to AI chip supplier problems.

Immediate Actions:
1. Daily meetings with department heads to address issues.
2. Exploring alternative suppliers for critical components.
3. Developing a communication strategy for clients regarding delays.

We're doing our best to manage these challenges, but we may need to consider some difficult decisions to mitigate the impact on our overall operations and client relationships.

I recommend we schedule an emergency meeting with the executive team to discuss our strategy moving forward.

Please advise on your availability for such a meeting.

Best regards,
Li Wei
General Manager, Shanghai Facility
