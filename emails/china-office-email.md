Dear Wei,

I hope this email finds you well. As I'm heading back to the US for an important meeting, I wanted to follow up on our recent supply chain discussions in Shanghai.

Could you please:

1. Send me a summary of the key points from our meeting with the car supply chain factory?
2. Prepare a detailed report on how their AI integration proposal aligns with our current systems?
3. Set up a video call for next week to discuss the next steps?

I'll be in transit for the next day, but please email me the summary, and I'll review it before my meeting in the US.

Thank you for your hard work on this project.

Best regards,
Ethan Chen
