Dear Mr. Chen,

I've reviewed Mr. Musk's schedule again. I can offer you a 15-minute slot on September 1st at 10:45 PM PT. I apologize for the late hour, but this is the best I can do given the current commitments.

Please confirm if this works for you.

Best regards,
Sarah Johnson

Dear Ms. Johnson,

I appreciate your efforts to find an earlier slot. While the timing is not ideal, I understand the constraints. However, 15 minutes seems insufficient for the complexity of the topics we need to discuss regarding the Venus project.

Is there any possibility of extending this to at least 30 minutes? If not, perhaps we could explore a daytime slot, even if it's a bit later in September?

Thank you for your patience and assistance.

Best regards,
Ethan Chen
