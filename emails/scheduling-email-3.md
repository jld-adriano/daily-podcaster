Dear Mr. Chen,

I apologize, but Mr. Musk's schedule has changed, and the September 1st slot is no longer available. The next available time would be November 3rd at 6:00 AM PT for 20 minutes.

Please let me know if you'd like to proceed with this option.

Best regards,
Sarah Johnson

Dear Ms. Johnson,

I must admit I'm finding this process rather challenging. The Venus project has critical deadlines that we need to discuss well before November. While I fully respect Mr. Musk's extremely busy schedule, is there truly no way to arrange a meeting in the next few weeks?

I'm happy to accommodate any time of day or day of the week. Even a virtual meeting would be acceptable if that helps with scheduling.

I apologize if I sound frustrated, but this meeting is crucial for the progress of the project.

Thank you for your continued efforts.

Best regards,
Ethan Chen
