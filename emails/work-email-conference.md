Given your groundbreaking work on ethical AI assistants at NeuraTech, we believe your insights would be invaluable to our attendees. We would be honored if you could present on the topic of "Balancing Innovation and Ethics in AI Development."

Please let me know if you would be interested in participating. We can discuss the details further if you accept.
