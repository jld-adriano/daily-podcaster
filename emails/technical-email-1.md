Ethan,

I've run the simulations for the Thermal Protection System (TPS) using our new AI-driven optimization algorithm. Here are the key findings:

1. The carbon-carbon composite with a nano-ceramic coating shows a 15% improvement in heat dissipation compared to traditional silica tiles.

2. Our AI model predicts that a variable-geometry TPS, which can adjust its surface area during different phases of atmospheric entry, could reduce peak heat loads by up to 30%.

3. The neural network-based real-time temperature monitoring system has achieved a 99.7% accuracy in predicting thermal stress points during simulated Venus atmospheric entry.

4. We need to address the issue of sulfuric acid corrosion in Venus's atmosphere. The AI suggests a self-healing polymer layer, but we need more data on long-term performance.

Let me know if you need any clarification on these points for your meeting with Elon.

Best,
Alicia
