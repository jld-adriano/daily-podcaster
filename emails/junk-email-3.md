Dear Mr. Chen,

I am contacting you regarding an unclaimed inheritance of $5,000,000 from a distant relative. As the executor of the will, I need your assistance to transfer these funds.

To claim your inheritance, please provide:
1. Your full name
2. Copy of your passport
3. Bank account details

A processing fee of $5,000 is required to release the funds.

Please treat this matter with utmost confidentiality.

Yours faithfully,
Barrister John Smith
