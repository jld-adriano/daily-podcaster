Subject: Christmas Plans for Buddy and Max

Hey Alex,

I know it's a bit early, but I wanted to discuss holiday plans for Buddy and Max. My family has invited me to spend Christmas with them this year, and they've said I'm welcome to bring the dogs. Would you be okay with me having them from December 23rd to 27th?

In return, you could have them for New Year's if you'd like. Let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Ethan

Hi Ethan,

I appreciate you thinking ahead about the holidays. I'm okay with you taking Buddy and Max for Christmas. They always loved playing in the snow at your parents' place.

As for New Year's, that would be great. I'm planning a small get-together at my place, and I know my friends would love to see the dogs.

One question - will your parents' new cat be there? Just want to make sure there won't be any issues since Buddy can be a bit anxious around new animals.

Thanks,
Alex
