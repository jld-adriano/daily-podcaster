Subject: Time for a change?

Mike,

Hey man, got a sec for some career talk?

So, NeuraTech's done it again. Dangled that promotion in front of me like a carrot, then snatched it away. I'm starting to feel like a hamster on a wheel here.

I'm thinking it might be time to jump ship. You're still at TechInnovate, right? Any openings for a slightly jaded but still brilliant AI dev?

If not, want to start our own company? I'm only half joking. We could call it "AI, AI, Oh!" (Get it? Like the song? No? Tough crowd.)

Let me know what you think. Or just send funny memes. Those help too.

Ethan
