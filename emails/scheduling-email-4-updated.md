Dear Mr. Chen,

I understand your frustration and the importance of this meeting. After shuffling some appointments, I can offer you a 25-minute in-person meeting with Mr. Musk on August 20th at 5:30 AM PT at our SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, CA.

This is the best option I can provide given the current circumstances. Please confirm if this works for you as soon as possible, as I'll need to rearrange other commitments to make this happen.

Best regards,
Sarah Johnson

Dear Ms. Johnson,

Thank you for your perseverance in finding a suitable time. I genuinely appreciate your efforts to accommodate this meeting.

While the timing is quite early, I understand the constraints and am willing to make it work. I confirm that I can attend the in-person meeting on August 20th at 5:30 AM PT at the SpaceX headquarters.

Could you please send over any necessary details for accessing the facility? Also, given the early hour, is there a nearby hotel you'd recommend for the night before?

Thank you again for your assistance and patience throughout this process.

Best regards,
Ethan Chen
