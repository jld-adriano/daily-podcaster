Hey Ethan,

Hope you're not drowning in code this week! A bunch of us are planning to hike Mt. Tamalpais this Saturday. We're thinking of taking the Dipsea Trail to Steep Ravine route - about 7 miles round trip with some great views.

Want to join? We're planning to meet at the trailhead at 7 AM to beat the crowds and the heat.

Let me know if you're in, and don't forget to bring your camera for those landscape shots!

Cheers,
Mike

P.S. Sarah from the astronomy club might join us. She's also into AI ethics - thought you two might hit it off.
