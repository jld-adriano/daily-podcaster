Dear Ethan,

I hope this email finds you well. I need to bring an urgent matter to your attention regarding our Shanghai facility.

We're experiencing some challenges with our workforce:

1. There's growing dissatisfaction among workers due to the recent changes in shift schedules.
2. We've received complaints about the new automated systems and concerns about job security.
3. There's a misunderstanding about the implementation of our new safety protocols.

I've scheduled a meeting with the union representatives for next week to discuss these issues. However, I wanted to keep you informed given the potential impact on our production timeline.

Please advise on how you'd like us to proceed.

Best regards,
Li Wei
