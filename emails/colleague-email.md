Subject: Good luck tomorrow!

Hey Ethan,

I heard through the grapevine about your big meeting tomorrow. Just wanted to wish you good luck! I'm sure you'll knock it out of the park.

Don't forget to breathe and be yourself. Your work speaks for itself.

Let's grab a beer after work tomorrow and you can tell me all about it (well, as much as you're allowed to, anyway).

Knock 'em dead!
Alex
