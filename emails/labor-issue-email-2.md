Subject: Update: Labor Negotiations at Shanghai Facility

Dear Ethan,

I'm writing to update you on our ongoing negotiations with the union representatives at our Shanghai facility. Here's a summary of the current situation:

1. We've reached an agreement on adjusting shift schedules to better accommodate workers' needs.
2. We're developing a comprehensive training program to address concerns about the new automated systems.
3. We've clarified the safety protocols, but there's still some resistance to the new procedures.

The negotiations are progressing, but slower than anticipated. We may need to consider some compromises to resolve the remaining issues quickly and avoid any potential work stoppages.

Your input on our negotiation strategy would be greatly appreciated.

Best regards,
Sarah Li
HR Director, Asia Pacific
