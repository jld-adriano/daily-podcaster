Subject: Alert: Major Supply Chain Disruption

From: Procurement Team <procurement@neuratech.cn>

Dear Ethan,

We're facing a critical situation with our supply chain that I need to bring to your immediate attention:

1. Our primary supplier of AI chips has informed us of a major production issue at their facility.
2. They're projecting a 4-6 week delay in delivering our next order.
3. This will significantly impact our production schedule and ability to meet client deadlines.

We're exploring alternative suppliers, but the specialized nature of these components makes finding a quick replacement challenging.

We need your guidance on how to proceed and communicate this delay to our clients.

Urgently awaiting your response,
John Zhang
Head of Procurement, Asia Pacific
