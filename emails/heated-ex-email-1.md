Alex,

Seriously? You're coming at me about Buddy's vet bills NOW? Where was this concern when you decided to feed him table scraps all the time, even though the vet explicitly told us not to?

I've always paid my share on time. Just because I forgot ONE bill doesn't mean you get to lecture me. I've been swamped with work, which you'd know if you bothered to ask instead of jumping down my throat.

And while we're at it, when are you going to return my hiking gear? It's been months. I need it for my trip next week.

Oh, don't you dare bring up the table scraps thing again, Ethan. That was ONE time at Christmas, and you know it. Stop exaggerating to make yourself look better.

Your work is not my problem anymore. You made that crystal clear when you chose your precious AI over our relationship. The least you can do is remember to pay for your dog's care. Is that too much to ask?

As for your hiking gear, I'll drop it off this weekend. Didn't realize you were so desperate for it. Maybe if you spent less time with your robots and more time outdoors, you'd have noticed it was missing sooner.
